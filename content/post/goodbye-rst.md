Today I've said goodbye to
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) for my website.

I have a personal preference for reStructuredText, because it has a clear spec
and is beautifully integrated into the Python ecosystem. Just look at
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and [Read the
Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

But my personal website remains a playground to test technology for customers.
Most of the static-site generator ecosystem, like
[netlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), only supports Markdown. So
to better support customers, let's ignore reStructuredText for a while and
focus on Markdown.
