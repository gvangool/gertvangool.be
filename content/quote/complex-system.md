A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a
working simple system. --- John Gall (from the book "Systemantics: How Systems
Really Work and How They Fail")
