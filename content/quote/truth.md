The truth isn’t the truth until people believe you, and they can’t believe you
if they don’t know what you’re saying, and they can’t know what you’re saying
if they don’t listen to you, and they won’t listen to you if you’re not
interesting, and you won’t be interesting unless you say things imaginatively,
originally, freshly.
