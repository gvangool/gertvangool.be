If all the insects were to disappear from the earth, within 50 years all life
on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the earth, within 50
years all forms of life would flourish. --- Jonas Salk (quoted in [Ken
Robinson says schools kill
creativity](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html))
